            <h2 class="titulo4">The Stunning Iguazu Falls</h2> 
            <p class="titulo6">From the border of Argentina Province, Misiones and the Brazilian state of Paraná the beautiful Iguazu Falls is located. This is an enormous and spacious national park from Argentina which classifies as the  world's largest waterfall, its the home of many animals and flora that forms a really important ecosystem. The character of the falls are formed by three layers of basalt and contain water from a canyon that drains into the Paraná River. These falls can be found from two main towns (one on each side), these are Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil and Puerto Iguazú in Argentina.These amazing Falls are important to their country since it reminds them about the power and the fragility of nature which just forms it into one of earths most brilliant natural sights. Its the most powerful waterfall in the world and just reminds Argentina of the respect for the natural world in just two different and spectacular ways. Turist just also love to travel here, since it's a really popular attraction for lots of people. It has a variety of activities, ecological places, and exotic animals you can visit and admire. Some things tourists really like to do are boat trips around the park and ferry tours to get even closer to the waterfall around them.

             <h2 class="titulo4"> Perito Glacier </h2>
             
                <p class="titulo6">The perito moreno glacier is a large thick ice glacier located in the lago Argentino in the Santa Cruz province, this glacier is from the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. It reaches the southern part of Lake Argentino, with a front of 5 km in length, going over the water with a height of about 60 m.
                Just 78 kilometers from town is the Perito Moreno Glacier, the world's third-largest freshwater reserve. It's only a two-hour drive from El Calafate to the glacier visitor center, and from there it's just a short walk to the glacier. Ice excursions tours range from an hour's walk over the ice formation to longer five-hour excursions for those who want to climb the glacier.
                Perito Moreno is perhaps the region's most famous glacier because it periodically cuts off Lake Argentina's major southern arm (known as Brazo Rico). The glacier advances across the lake until it meets the opposite shoreline, at which point the ice tongue becomes "grounded" (not floating) and forms a natural dam.With an experienced guide and all the necessary safety equipment, you'll clamber over deep blue crevasses, see incredible ice caves and seracs, and splash through rivers of meltwater. You will also walk the balconies in front of the glacier and visit the cafés before returning to Punta Banderas.This excursion is suitable for people aged 6 to 70, and is ideal for families with young children or people with limited mobility who want to get up close to the glacier, close enough to touch it!

                <h2 class="titulo4">The Highest Volcano in the World!</h2>
                
                    <p class="titulo6">Ojos del Salado is a remarkable active volcano shared between the boundary between Argentina and Chile. It is located between both of these places and is the tallest volcano of all earth being only overcome by the volcano Aconcagua. Due to its location the mountain presents really dry and hot climate conditions which make snow show only during invernal periods or  around the higher levels of the mountain.  There are also fumaroles (surface vents) which forbid the volcano to erupt since all the time it has existed. Ojos del Salado is not only important for Argentina but for all the world, it is considered a really important feature on the 7 Summits(the highest mountains of each of the seven traditional continents) due to its amazing height that stands out among the rest of volcanoes in the world. These attractions can really bring lots of tourist attention since it's not only tall but pretty from long distances, even though it's really high and steep is really dangerous for tourists who try to climb it all to the point (especially amateur climbers). You can take the risk of a really bad injury or even death.
